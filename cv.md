   <h3>My goal is to start a career as a Junior Android Developer</h3> 
   
   I met Android development at the university on the course *"Mobile Application Development"*. One of the tasks then we had a group project on which we developed the application. My role in this project was directly writing the application code. What I successfully, but not without difficulty, managed. The code for this application found here: [GitHub AppToDo](https://github.com/maria-kaminskaya/AppToDo). This was the beginning of my knowledge and interest for the development of mobile applications for the Android system.
	
  <h3>My Experience</h3>
  
  In addition, **I have experience** in developing *sites*, one of which posted on free hosting, in HTML / CSS, as well as C #, *information systems*, *databases* using SQL, mobile applications on *Android*. I know also with such *technologies and programming languages* as C, C #, Java, JavaScript, SQL, TransactSQL, VBA, XML, XSLT, Kotlin and *programs* like Photoshop, Sony Vegas Pro, Microsoft Visual Studio, Eclipse, Microsoft SQL Server, Cisco Packet Tracer, Android Studio, with Windows and Ubuntu. The site found here: http://km-nvxh.gearhostpreview.com/.
	
  In terms of **self-education**, I read books on programming (*“Programming. Principles and Practices for Using C”* by Bjarn Straustrup, *“Pro C # 5.0 and the .NET 4.5 Framework”* by Andrew Troelsen, *“Android for Developers”* by Paul Daytel), I listened *intensively from Android* to Technopolis developed and completed *Java Core It-Academy courses*. I also completed an *internship* at Akordirect.
	
  <h3>English</h3>
  
  **I study English** for three years at the university. As part of self-study, I watch a lot of *films* and *cartoons* in English (both with subtitles and without). I read some *professional articles*, *videos* of the same nature.

<h2>Thanks for attention!</h2>
